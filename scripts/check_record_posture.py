"""Gate 3: records-directory posture.

The catalogue is at scaffold stage. This gate asserts that the repository
says what it means: records may not appear before the schema projection
gate exists, and every record that lands carries the canonical
Information Asset identifier form and type.

It does not validate record content. The schema gate (CR-IA-CAT-02)
validates records against schemas/entity.schema.json; the documentation
gate (CR-IA-CAT-03) validates them against docs/RECORD-STANDARD.md; the
population CR (CR-IA-CAT-04) admits the first records.
